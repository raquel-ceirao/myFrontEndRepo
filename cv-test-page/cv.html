                    </p>
                    <p>From Clinical Psychologist to Programmer, it’s been a wild ride. Just like moving from Macau to Canada and finally to Portugal.
                    I’ve learnt to be both organised and flexible, ready to face different challenges while armed with the amazing ability to dish out terrible puns and deliver results in three different languages at the same time! As a Ravenclaw, I take learning new skills very Sirius-ly, such as Java, Javascript, MySQL, Git and many others.
                    I’ve started my journey in the IT world as a recruiter in various companies, searching for the best developers I could find. I became fascinated with the conversations I had with them and started learning on the sly the beginnings of Javascript, HTML and CSS. Soon enough, an opportunity arouse to embark on an intensive 14 weeks of coding all day long @ &lt;Academia de Código_&gt;. After this bootcamp, I am ready to take on any project I can get my hands on, you can “SELECT COUNT(*) FROM me;”!</p>
